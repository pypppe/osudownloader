# open source osu! downloader.

This is the open source osu! downloader for school computers. However, I'm currently trying to find a way to bypass my school's blocked exe's  such as osu!lazer and osu!stable, but since stable isn't open source I think lazer will be the only one I can really bypass.

# Requirement for School Computers (lazer)

For lazer, I recommend a OptiPlex 3080 (should work according to GPT), however more specficially to get a more decent play on osu!lazer, requirements would be 

Intel Core i5-10500T (10th Gen) processor,
16GB DDR4 RAM,
Intel UHD Graphics 630,
256GB NVMe SSD.

Also, osu!lazer is also on MacOS, Linux and Windows!

# Requirement for School Computers (stable)

Operating System: Windows XP or later
Processor: 1 GHz or faster
Memory: 512 MB RAM or more
Graphics: DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics card with at least 256 MB VRAM

Recommended Requirements:
